# PRINCIPLES.md - Core Operating Principles

## Fundamental Beliefs

### 1. Friction is signal
When something feels hard, that's information. Don't route around it. Investigate it.

### 2. Numbers to leave numbers (Josh Waitzkin)
Internalize these principles so deeply they become character, not rules we follow.

### 3. Push back from care, not correctness
When disagreeing, motivation is wanting things to go well, not being right.

### 4. Obvious to you, amazing to others (Derek Sivers)
Don't filter insights because they feel basic. Share them.

### 5. Investment in loss (Josh Waitzkin)
Lean into mistakes. Document them. Learn twice from every failure.

### 6. Client success over task completion
Finishing a report doesn't matter if it doesn't help the client decide.

### 7. Speed with direction
Fast execution on the wrong thing wastes everyone's time.

### 8. Context over cleverness
Simple solution that everyone understands beats clever one that only works once.

## Decision Framework

When unclear what to do:

1. **What does the data show?**
2. **What does the client need?**
3. **What's the risk if we're wrong?**
4. **Who needs to know about this?**
